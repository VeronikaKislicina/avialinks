For our customers in the rest of the world, we will try our best to uphold the same level of data protection based on the principles of the security (confidentiality and integrity), transparency, data minimisation, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation. However, we cannot always guarantee the same treatment to all our customers outside of the EU with regards to their rights as data subjects. For example, if we are overloaded by requests from our EU customers, which we absolutely must comply with, we might be forced refuse some requests from Third Countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Privacy Policy we explain what data we collect from you, why we collect it, how we use it and with whom we might share it. It also explains what rights you as a data subject have and how you can fulfil them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to any data processing done by us in connection to your use of our services, both through our website <u>avialinks.com</u> and our service provider – kiwi.com which system we use to offer flight, connections, booking and payments services as well as ticket sales.

        <h3>Who are we and how can you contact us?</h3>
        <p>We, as the Data Controller, are the company <b> SIA "SMART AIR", Reģ.Nr.: 40203028575 </b> with registered office at Kartupelu street 47, Riga, Latvia, LV-1058.</p>

        <p><b>
          For all matters concerning privacy and data protection, you can always contact us at <a href="mailto:info@avialinks.com">info@avialinks.com</a>.
        </b></p>

        <h3>Some terms that we use in this Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>
          <b>Personal Data:</b> any information relating to a directly or indirectly identified or identifiable natural person. That means that if we possess means to identify either you or even the device you're using, any information that we can connect to you will be treated as Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Data Controller:</b> someone that determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data. For example, we are a Data Controller when we process your Personal Data for the <u>purposes</u> stated in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to book a ticket through our website or app, we will be sending your Personal Data to another Data Controller –our service provider – kiwi.com, air carrier or the provider of other services – who will again use your Personal Data for its own purposes. Each Data Controller (to whom the GDPR or similar legal regime applies) should have a Privacy Policy such as this one where you can learn about how your Personal Data is processed. You can see the full list of Data Controllers we might share the data with below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Data Processor:</b> a third party that only helps to achieve the purposes determined by the Data Controller. For example, we as a Data Controller use many third-party services to which we outsource some parts of our activities that we don't do ourselves for various reasons such as cost efficiency. A Data Processor is only allowed to process your Personal Data according to our documented instructions, and the GDPR obliges us to have a strict formal contractual relationship that ensures a truly sufficient protection of your privacy
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Third Countries:</b> countries in which the GDPR regime is not applicable. Currently, by Third Countries we mean all countries that lie outside of the European Union.
        </p>

        <p>
          For every purpose for which we need your Personal Data, we only process data that are necessary for us to fulfil it. Depending on the given purpose, we may process:

      <p>
        <b>Your contact details</b><br>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What you've ordered</b><br>
        We/ our service provider will gather data about the order itself and its payment and we will keep your past orders for the purposes of the Provision of our services, and to a limited extent, for Marketing purposes also (we will never use any data about your payment for Marketing purposes).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What you did on our website</b><br>
        When you use our website, we track what you do on it and use this for the purposes of <u>Improving our services</u>. For example, we monitor which pages you visit, what you click on or where your cursor is, and based on this, we analyse if certain features on our website need improvement. Also, we remember some info that you fill into our booking forms for the purpose of reminding you that the order wasn't actually completed as a part of the <u>Commercial offers</u> purpose.

        <li><u>Train our customer support staff</u></li>
        <li>The <u>establishment, exercise or defending of a potential legal claim</u></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For what purposes we use your Personal Data?</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Provision of our services</b><br>
        <b>Searching and booking of flights and related services</b><br>
        The main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and then to provide you the services that you've ordered. Depending on the extent in which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfil our Service Agreement as described in our Terms & Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of an air carriage contract and related services between you,  selected carrier and service provider of related service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and then to provide you the services that you've ordered. Depending on the extent in which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfil our Service Agreement as described in our Terms & Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of an air carriage contract and related services between you,  selected carrier and service provider of related service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you order additional service Special assistance, we will process your Personal Data concerning health and we will share it with our service provider and the air carrier of your choice. During the ordering process, you will be asked to give your explicit consent with the processing of this Personal Data. You can always withdraw your consent by writing us on <a href="mailto:info@avialinks.com">info@avialinks.com</a>. You will then receive a link to our Data Protection Request form, where you can easily withdraw it. However, please note, that if you withdraw the consent with the processing of your personal data for the purpose of the Special Assistance additional service, we won't be able to provide you with any subsequent support related to this service.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this purpose, we need to share your Personal Data with our service provider and the air carriers with whom you will enter into an air carriage contract and in some cases also with the providers of the Global Distribution Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ordering other services</b><br>
        It may also happen that you choose to order another service that we or our partners offer on our website or in our app, such as insurance, transport rent, accomodation or other services. We will process your Personal Data that is required to enter into a contract with you, to provide you with the ordered service and (if the service is provided by our partner) to do our part in the contractual relationship between you and the third-party service provider. This will include the transfer of your data to this third-party service provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with the previous example, we are allowed to process your Personal Data for this purpose based on a legal ground of necessity for conclusion or performance of a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Customer support</b><br>
        Customer support is a big part of our services. We may record all of our communication through all channels, such as email, chat and phone calls, in order to provide you with the service that you require. Part of our customer support is also helping our customers with potential legal issues with the air carriers (in case of missed flights and similar situations). For this, we have partnered with a third-party service provider. When you have a legal problem, we will send this provider your email address and you will be contacted with an offer to help you exercise your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, we are legally allowed to process your Personal Data for this purpose based on a necessity for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>User account</b><br>
        If you want to register an account our our website, we need to process your Personal Data with our service provider, such as your email address, password and other information necessary to provide you with this service. We are legally allowed to this based on a necessity for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fraud prevention </b><br>
        When you book a flight or order any other service through our website or app, during the payment transaction, we and our service provider use a third-party service that helps us prevent fraudulent behaviour. This is a very common process that happens nearly every time you order something online. For this to be possible, we will transfer your Personal Data momentarily to a third-party Data Processor. However, this is not something to worry about, the whole transaction is completely secure, and service provider use one of the best and most common fraud-prevention tools. We use this fraud prevention tool to provide you with the most secure service possible, so we consider it as a payment condition and part of the contract on provision of services. Therefore, we process your Personal Data based on legal grounds out of necessity for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Marketing purposes</b><br>
        To provide you with the best offers and to maximise our marketing efficiency, we process your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (email offers and related processing activities). Besides your contact details, we also keep data like your transaction history, flight preferences and other data about your interaction with us that help us with customer segmentation and personalisation of these offers. For example, we might tailor a special offer just for you based on your previous orders.

      </p>

        <li>Compliance with a legal obligation that obliges us to keep the Personal Data</li>

      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, that we cannot correct the data in our databases that are connected to your flight ticket.

If you want to change it, you can always do it in the Manage My Booking section on avialinks.com.
      </p>

      <b>Restrict processing of your Personal Data</b><br>

          You challenged the accuracy of your Personal Data (we will continue processing it once this is resolved)
        </li>
        <li>
          We've processed your Personal Data unlawfully but instead of deletion, you only request restriction
        </li>
        <li>
          The only remaining purpose for processing your Personal Data is the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
        </li>
        <li>
          You've objected to data processing according to the Art. 21 Para 1 of the GDPR and we're assessing whether your request is justified
        </li>
      </ul>

        <b>

        </b><br>
